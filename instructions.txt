Implement a fuzzy controller capable of controlling a paddle in a classic Pong game4 a suitable,
simplified implementation has been provided on GitHub5
. The controller should be implemented
using scikit-fuzzy6
. The controller will have access to two values: the distances between the center
of the ball and the center of the paddle in X anf Y dimension. The aim is to deflect the ball every
time and not let the Opponent score. In comparison with the classic version, this implementation
provides a different way of increasing the speed of the reflected ball. If the ball is deflected using
the edgemost 25% of the paddle, its speed increases by 10%. As the speeds of the paddles are
limited, at some point the provided naive Opponent will not be able to keep up.
